        In Module 8, we will learn about common and special-cause variations and
        the role of statistical control charts in identifying them. We will
        focus on three common control charts, the p-chart, the c-chart, and the
        Xbar-R chart. We will learn when each type of chart is used, and how
        they are constructed and interpreted. Using statistical methods, we will
        learn to recognize if processes are capable of meeting customer
        specifications. Finally, we will consider how newly emerging
        technologies are making it possible to extensively and routinely use the
        techniques of statistical process control. In todayâ€™s competitive world producing world class products. In order to survive in the competitive world market producing different product with best techniques, it is important for the firms to take extra mileage to the quality of product and service they provide. In the recent world consumer are aware of the products and service provided by the other firms. Also today there are government empahasis on the quality issues of the products.
