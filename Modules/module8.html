        In Module 3, we will learn about common and special-cause variations and
        the role of statistical control charts in identifying them. We will
        focus on three common control charts, the p-chart, the c-chart, and the
        Xbar-R chart. We will learn when each type of chart is used, and how
        they are constructed and interpreted. Using statistical methods, we will
        learn to recognize if processes are capable of meeting customer
        specifications. Finally, we will consider how newly emerging
        technologies are making it possible to extensively and routinely use the
        techniques of statistical process control.
