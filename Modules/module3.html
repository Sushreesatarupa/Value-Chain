        Market Size Defined
Have you heard the phrases 'the market for this is' or 'the market for that is' and wondered the meaning? Market size is a measurement of the total volume of a given market. For now, think of market size in terms of a pie chart (think of a circle). The entirety of the circle represents the market size.

        Estimating Market Size
Let's say XYZ Company was contemplating expanding their operations. They make widgets currently but want to explore the possibility of making gizmos. The company needs to calculate the market size for gizmos prior to commencing production.

In an attempt to calculate market size, XYZ Company looked at sales by their competitors and also analyzed the end user - the consumer. XYZ Company calculated that the current market size of gizmos was $100 million in 2014 in the United States. By reviewing sales statistics from their competitors, they learned that ABC Company had 2013 sales of $40 million, and DEF Company had 2013 sales of $20 million.

Since the market size of gizmos is $100 million, and since XYZ Company learned that both ABC Company's and DEF Company's production lines were behind schedule (sales were backed up for months), XYZ Company may be making a wise decision in filling in the $40 million gap in market size. Each company's respective piece of the pie in the market size is their market share.
