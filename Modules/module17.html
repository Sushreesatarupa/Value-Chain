        In this module, you will analyze the value chain activities. You will
        address questions such as: Which of these activities are the key cost
        drivers? What will impact the total costs? How can these activities be
        reinvisioned to reduce cost and create better coherence among
        activities? Which of these activities are key value drivers?
