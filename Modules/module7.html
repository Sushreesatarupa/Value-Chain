        The sourcing of materials is a major function in supply chain
        management, you will learn about make-or-buy decisions and the theory of
        transaction cost economics that undergirds such decisions. Finally, you
        will learn about the bullwhip effect which explains the magnification of
        demand variability in a supply chain and the role of information in
        mitigating this problem. Within each organisation such as a manufacturer, the supply chain includes all functions involved receiving and fulfilling a customerâ€™s requirements. These functions include new product development, marketing, operations, distribution, finance and customer services.

A supply chain is dynamic and involves the constant flow of information, product and funds between different stages. For example, one retailer provides the product as well as pricing and available information to the customer. The customer transfers funds to retailer. Retailer convey point of sales data as well as replenishment orders to the warehouse or distributor, who transfers the replenishment order via trucks back to the store.
