        At the heart of an organization’s planning and control function is its
        budget. In this module, you will explore the purpose of budgeting, the
        role of managers and employees in budgeting, and related implications.
        You will also develop an organization’s budget, ultimately understanding
        the iterative nature among the budget’s key components: the operations,
        financing, and capital investments budgets.
