        At the heart of an organization’s planning and control function is its
        budget. In this module, you will explore the purpose of budgeting, the
        role of managers and employees in budgeting, and related implications.
        You will also develop an organization’s budget, ultimately understanding
        the iterative nature among the budget’s key components: the operations,
        financing, and capital investments budgets.
        Budgeting is a vital part in the planning and control process. Planning provides a framework which helps management to develop a plan of action, to estimate future revenues and costs, to anticipate future events, to reduce uncertainty about the future and to increase the chances of achieving the goals and objectives of the organisation through coordination of plans.

Control is the process of using feedback on actual performances and results, comparing the actual results with the plans, measuring its deviations from plans and policies and finally taking corrective actions to bring all future activities in line with the plan (budget).
