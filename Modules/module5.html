        Decisions are at the heart of all organizations. In this module, you
        will also explore the nature and role of relevant information in common
        business decisions, and how such information facilitates these decisions
        and helps managers and employees avoid common pitfalls. You will also
        consider how the financial perspective adopted by accountants
        complements other, qualitative perspectives.
