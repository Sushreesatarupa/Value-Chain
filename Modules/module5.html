        Decisions are at the heart of all organizations. In this module, you
        will also explore the nature and role of relevant information in common
        business decisions, and how such information facilitates these decisions
        and helps managers and employees avoid common pitfalls. You will also
        consider how the financial perspective adopted by accountants
        complements other, qualitative perspectives. <br>
        Decision making may be defined as the selection of one course of action from two or more alternative courses of action according to George Terry, “as the selection based on certain criteria lo select one appropriate alternative out of two or more alternatives. ” It is a part of problem-solving. There would be no decision for teachers to make if there were no problems.

Decision implies that we make a choice from several of many possibilities. It is the process of choice which leads to action. A teacher can make a number of decisions in his/her different spheres of activity. For a teacher the decision-making has a special significance.

Decision-making controls the entire activity of an organization and lends clearly too different tasks to be carried out.
