Dhriiti (A leading NGO working in the Women Entrepreneurship) and Impact Hub Manila (pioneer in organizing international brands of hackathons) in collaboration with Project Her & Now of GIZ, Nasscom Foundation, Villigro and NuSocia announced the launch of the first edition of Scipt4HER Hackathon.

According to the Sixth Economic Census, women constitute only 14% of India’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. In addition to the regular entrepreneurial challenges, they have to also fight gender stereotypes. For rural women, the challenge just becomes four-fold.

Scipt4HER Hackathon will allow participants to test their passion for innovation, problem-solving, design thinking, and programming skills by solving the pressing problems faced by women entrepreneurs and drive gender-responsive solutions.

# Value-Chain-Study

## Inspiration
After checking all the problem statements, we chose to build our project because we couldn't find a website where a person could quickly learn about the business value chain. Since these business value chain somehow determines how strong will the business stand in future. To make it easier for aspiring rural women entrepreneurs, we thought to include various local languages so that their understanding of the topic would be clear.

## What it does
This project tries to tackle the problem that Rural Women entrepreneurs face due to a lack of understanding of the business value chain. Our task is intended to fill the knowledge gap in between and help rural women entrepreneurs strive more. Our website provides the solution to this problem. It bridges the knowledge gap. Our website offers learning resources to people who need them. We have kept several modules that together teach about the value chain. We also have options to find events or people and also discuss in a discussion forum. We also have a bot to help anyone on the website and a newsletter subscription to keep the users notified about important events.

## How we built it
We have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the website. The chatbot was built using Javascript. The discussion forum was built with Wix. And the backend is created using node, express,cockroackDB.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time working with a chatbot and discussion forum. We also implemented our webpage in multiple languages for the first time. We also implemented a working newsletter and automated email delivery.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite all the obstacles, we are delighted that we could incorporate all our ideas into our website. We even learned many new things, and we are proud of ourselves!

## What's next for Value-Chain-Study
Due to the limited amount of time, we couldn't build a polished prototype with good UI/UX and many features. We have thought of extending this to the outside world after making a polished product. We will try to improve the looks and work o this solution and think of new features that we can add.

## Built With

- CSS
- JavaScript 
- Bootstrap
- SQL
- Adobe illustrator
- Wix
- Postman
- Cockroach DB
- Node.js
