According to the Sixth Economic Census, women constitute only 14% of India’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. In addition to the regular entrepreneurial challenges, they have to also fight gender stereotypes. For rural women, the challenge just becomes four-fold.

Scipt4HER Hackathon will allow participants to test their passion for innovation, problem-solving, design thinking, and programming skills by solving the pressing problems faced by women entrepreneurs and drive gender-responsive solutions.
