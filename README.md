Dhriiti (A leading NGO working in the Women Entrepreneurship) and Impact Hub Manila (pioneer in organizing international brands of hackathons) in collaboration with Project Her & Now of GIZ, Nasscom Foundation, Villigro and NuSocia announced the launch of the first edition of Scipt4HER Hackathon.

According to the Sixth Economic Census, women constitute only 14% of India’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. In addition to the regular entrepreneurial challenges, they have to also fight gender stereotypes. For rural women, the challenge just becomes four-fold.

Scipt4HER Hackathon will allow participants to test their passion for innovation, problem-solving, design thinking, and programming skills by solving the pressing problems faced by women entrepreneurs and drive gender-responsive solutions.
